=======================================
Overdue author correspondence procedure
=======================================

The goal of the PubMed process is to take articles through all the stages of the process as quickly as possible. Therefore any delays at one step or another cause overall delay in availablity of the article for archiving.

It is important for team members to adhere to the procedures outlined below and follow them to the point.

It is important task of a manager to monitor and resolve situations when article is "stuck" at certain point.

Instructions for team members
-----------------------------
Occasionally team members need to request author's input to proceed with the review. Usually authors reply on such enquiries within 2-3 days. However, in situations when this is not the case, team member needs to follow the procedure below to remind authors about his/her equiry.

1. Send 1'st reminder to corresponding author after 4 days, since initial request email.
2. Send 2'nd reminder to corresponding author after 4 days, since 1's reminder
3. Contact Christopher Fick to get the emails of all authors of the article
4. Send 3'd (last) reminder to all authors
5. If you do not get a reply after 4 days, contact your manager and agree that you put this aricle on hold.
When agreed, your manager is responsible to put the paper on-hold. From that point manager is responsible for follow up of the article.
6. When manager contacts team member with an update from author (for the article which has been put on-hold), team member needs to resume review of the article. From that point team member is responsible for communication with author. If further follow up is required, then it should be done in accordance with this procedure (i.e. new 1'st, 2'nd and 3'd reminders if required).


Instructions for manager

1. Go to Overdue Author Correspondence dashboard.
2. Check "Days since Assignment Date" column for the artickes which exceed 15 days.
3. Go through each of the overdue articles with team member and find out the reason of the delay.
