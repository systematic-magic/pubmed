================
Quota procedures are targeted at simplification of article assignment process. 
Clear procedures bring transparency and efficiency to the overall review process.
It is important for all team members to adhere to the procedures outlined below and follow them to the point.


Roles

Team member - person who reviews articles |br|
Manager - Bharathii |br|
Next Level Manager - Zoya


Instructions for team members
==============================
Every team member is responsible for providing up to date information about his/her weekly review quota (i.e. how many articles he/she can review per week). He/she should do it in advance before assignment dates. 

"In advance" means on a day before assignment and no later than 23:00 ET (Eastern Time Zone)

For example:
- For Monday assignments information about quota should be provided no later than Sunday 23:00 ET (Eastern Time Zone)
- For Thursday assignment information about quota should be provide no later than Wednesday 23:00 ET (Eastern Time Zone)

To simplify the process and to remove the burden of constant updates we introduce quota table in Production spreadsheet.
No more updates by email is required. Updates should be done in the spreadsheet.

All team members need to fill out "Default quota" cell below his/her name. Value of "Default quota" will be automatically propagated to cells below, which hold values for each week of a year.

Once "Default quota" is filled out, team members just need to update the quota value when it is different (from default) for corresponding week(s). So updates are required on ad-hoc basis only.


Default quota update
--------------------
1. Navigate to "Quota" tab in the Production spreadsheet <link here>

2. Find your name at the top of the page

3. Type in the value for your default quota in the row "Default quota" below your name

.. NOTE::
	
	If you processed your quota, you can ask manager for additional articles. It is up to manager (and depending on availability of the articles) whether to provide you with additional articles or not.

.. NOTE::
	
	If you experience any issues or have questions regarding the process, please contact your manager.


Ad-hoc quota update (when it is different from your default quota)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions for manager
========================

Important: Quota checking is important part of article assignment process. It is critical to assign articles within specified quotas to eliminate review delays and overload of team members.

The steps below should be followed every time manager assigns articles to team members.

1. Navigate to "Quota" tab in the Production spreadsheet <link here> and check the quota for team member.

2. Go to "Assigned Articles Dashboard" <link here>

3. Check the number of unprocessed (not reviewed) articles for the team member. (If there is no quota specified, please see "Exception cases" section below.)

4. If the number of unprocessed articles is smaller than team member's quota, then you can assign more articles to meet the quota.(I.e. if team member has 5 unprocessed articles and his/her quota equals 20, then you can assign extra 15 articles)

5. If the number of unprocessed articles equals quota, then no articles can be assigned to team member.

6. If the number of unprocessed articles is higher than quota, then manager needs to contact team member and agree on the articles (which exceed quota) which can be removed from team member's name. Removed articles should return to the pool of available articles for assignment to other team members.


Instructions for manager: Exception cases
-----------------------------------------

1. If there is no quota specified or if you are not sure about the value of the quota, please contact team member directly and agree correct quota amount. It should be noted that if such cases repeat for the same team member, please report to the next level manager.
